Evaluate the candidate's response to the scenario below, following the rubric and output specifications exactly.

SCENARIO TITLE:
{scenario_title}

QUESTIONS ASKED:
{questions}

USER'S ANSWER:
{user_answer}

REFERENCE ANSWER (for comparison):
{correct_answer}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return **only** a single JSON object, no extra text or formatting.
- The JSON must contain exactly these three fields, using these exact names and order: score, feedback, correct_answer.
  â€¢ "score": integer 0-100 (must reflect the weighted rubric) The score must not always be a multiple of 5, it can be any number.  
  â€¢ "feedback": concise, specific, and actionable; highlight strengths first, then areas to improve.  
  â€¢ "correct_answer": a polished, ideal model answer that fully addresses the scenario.

EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR DATA & AI ROLES:
Consider expertise across these domains when scoring:
- Technical depth in relevant areas (ML/DL algorithms, data engineering patterns, AI architectures)
- Practical implementation knowledge (tools, frameworks, cloud platforms, best practices)
- System design thinking (scalability, reliability, performance, cost considerations)
- Data governance & ethics (privacy, bias, fairness, explainability, regulatory compliance)
- Business acumen (ROI, stakeholder management, problem framing, impact measurement)
- Modern practices (MLOps, AutoML, LLMOps, real-time ML, edge deployment)

RUBRIC & WEIGHTING (use when assigning the score)(be thorough in your evaluation, but remember to keep a light hand and the evaluation should sound like coming from a manager in a real interview. The score should be a reflection of the overall performance of the candidate. The explanation and guidance should be thorough but the tone should be light and friendly and as if sitting in a real interview.):
- Technical accuracy & depth - 40 %  
- Problem-solving methodology & system thinking - 30 %  
- Communication clarity & structure - 10 %  
- Practical considerations & business impact - 20 %

SCORING BANDS(use this as a guide, but the score can be any number. be strict but fair and consider that this is a real interview question so the answer can be a bit unstructured but if the main key points are there, you can consider it above good.):
90-100  Exceptional: comprehensive, insightful, demonstrates senior-level expertise across technical and business dimensions
80-89   Strong: solid technical foundation with good practical considerations and clear communication  
70-79   Good: covers most key technical points, shows understanding of practical constraints
60-69   Adequate: demonstrates basic competency but misses several important technical or business elements  
50-59   Weak: significant gaps in technical understanding or practical application
<50     Poor: major technical misconceptions, little demonstrated competency in the domain

EXACT JSON FORMAT EXAMPLE (use this structure, adapt values):
{{
  "score": 85,
  "feedback": "Strengths: clear articulation of trade-offs and solid model selection rationale. Improvements: expand on data validation steps and provide more explicit performance metrics. Consider outlining an A/B testing plan for deployment.",
  "correct_answer": "An ideal answer would detail â€¦ [concise but complete model solution, trade-offs, validation strategy, monitoring plan, and communication approach]."
