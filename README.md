# IntrVu - AI-Powered Interview Preparation Platform

> **The interview prep tool that actually understands what you're trying to learn**

In today's brutal job market where every ML interview feels like a PhD defense, IntrVu is the intelligent companion that doesn't just throw random questions at you‚Äîit learns your weaknesses, adapts to your skill level, and actually helps you improve. Think of it as having a senior ML engineer as your personal tutor, but without the $200/hour price tag.

## üéØ What Makes This Different (And Actually Useful)

### The Problem with Other Interview Prep Tools
Most interview prep platforms are like those generic flashcards you used in college‚Äîstatic, boring, and completely disconnected from real-world scenarios. They don't understand context, can't adapt to your learning style, and definitely can't give you meaningful feedback on your thought process.

### How IntrVu Solves It
- **Intelligent Question Generation**: Our AI doesn't just regurgitate textbook questions. It creates scenarios based on real interview patterns, your skill level, and current industry trends
- **Adaptive Learning**: The system learns from your responses and adjusts difficulty accordingly. Struggling with neural networks? It'll focus there. Acing everything? Time to crank up the complexity
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get instant, detailed feedback on your answers, not just "correct/incorrect" but actual explanations of why your approach works (or doesn't)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From software development and data science to machine learning and system design, we cover the full spectrum of technical interview topics

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture That Actually Works

## üíº Why This Matters for Your Career

### The Job Market Reality
The tech job market is more competitive than ever. Companies aren't just looking for people who can code‚Äîthey want engineers who can think critically, solve complex problems, and communicate their solutions effectively across software development, data science, and machine learning domains. Traditional interview prep tools don't prepare you for this reality.

### How IntrVu Prepares You
- **Critical Thinking Development**: Our scenario-based challenges force you to think through problems across multiple domains, not just memorize solutions
